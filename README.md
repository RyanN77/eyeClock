# eyeClock

# Objective
The purpose of this goal was intended to prevent staring at screens for long hours, thus affecting people's eyes and eyesight (including myself) over time. A biological study recommends having a 20 second break looking away from the screen and focusing on an abstract object for every 20 minutes spent on the screen.

# Functionality
As of now, it contains a very basic functionality with a few buttons. It includes a countdown timer which will ring upon reaching 0, letting the person know that it is recommended to take a break or when their break is finished. 
A continuous looping may be implemented in the future for convenience. 

# How To Use
With the files, open the HTML file and click the button the start the timer.
